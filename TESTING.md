## Testing

### Validators

The following validators were used to make sure there were no syntax errors in the project.

[W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

- No errors

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) 

- No errors

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

- No errors

To test the python code, I used the built in python extension to check for PEP8 compliance

- Errors in auto generated files from Django were left untouched:
    Migration files, settings.py, manage.py, checkout/init.py
- Line too long errors
    The remaining line too long errors are lines that can not be shortened without breaking the code
